GOF
Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

Concept
A class cannot have multiple instances. Once created, the next time onward, you use only the existing instance. This approach helps you restrict unnecessary object creations in a centralized system. The approach also promotes easy maintenance.
